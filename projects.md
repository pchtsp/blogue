## This page

A list of personal projects in arbitrary order.

## Los hermanos y las bicicletas

This is a blog we did with my two brothers while we crossed France from north (we started at Gantt, Belgium) to south (we ended in Toulouse, France). The trip took two weeks: we camped and brought our own food with us.

We took turns to write each day's story. Many things, happened, as is expected. The link to the blog is [here](https://loshermanosylasbicicletas.blogspot.com).

## Perros-del-viernes

This project lasted for 1.x years. Every Friday I published a photo of a dog I found while walking on the street. I took care of asking for name, age, etc.

The full album can be found [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wN43hGcw6ynriV5P2).
In order to see the description, one needs to click on the photo and then on the (i) button in the upper right screen.

At some point the project was also shared [in instagram](https://www.instagram.com/perrosdelviernes/).

## Google maps downloader

A simple script to download the image map of a city in "google maps style". It uses the Google-maps API. I've downloaded so far: [Madrid](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMDSPQvY7Vdi5j7qstvuhKMdnkDbbuPf/view?usp=sharing), [Toulouse](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y5WYNIUAE1F5apt1BxtX_dtdMpRJtynC/view?usp=sharing),  [Barcelona](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1oJFXBwyt_RkoxPc0bLtQ8aXc8np8n-/view?usp=sharing), [Lima](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h3P62SpUu5w-rai8YZF-P4-nUmDa7pwx/view?usp=sharing) and [Antwerp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rllSHLHc4i83cXqR-uW4sL7qdGruQjJo/view?usp=sharing).

The code for the script [is here](https://github.com/pchtsp/gmaps-downloader).

## Bus-routes visualizations

This project *took* the routes of a well-known Lima routes app and show them via a web interface. By clicking somewhere in the map, it showed all the routes that passed nearby. Sadly I do not have an image to show for now. 

The code of the app [is here](https://github.com/pchtsp/combiLima).
