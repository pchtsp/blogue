## This page

This page is the "About" page. Here I explain the purpose of my site. Please continue reading.

## This site

The purpose of this site is to immortalize (in github's Arctic vault no less) all the rants and opinions I've accumulated over my ~~long and prosperous~~ short and otherwise uneventful existence. Sometimes I will write many things. Sometimes I will not write anything. There's no main subject and no single language. I hate taking decisions and I hate classifications.

## Me

Many years ago during an informal professional gathering a friend described me and my brother as "engineers who like to ride bicycles". Although 100% at the time, I was slightly pissed off to listen what was 20+ years of my existence summarized on such a simple phrase. Also, I was intrigued. If this friend thinks this of me: what may other people, who know me less still, think? With time, I've learned to appreciate the exactness of the definition. Also with time, I've accumulated some other badges / tags: PhD in Operations Research, [double](https://baobabsoluciones.es/)-[entrepreneur](https://hackpackinglife.com/) and ~~President of the United States of America~~.

Somewhere else I gave this description which I think it's still valid (and may be for a long time): Engineer, programmer and scientist. Loves solving puzzles, organizing stuff and customer service. During his free (and not-so-free) time he's a cyclist and professional skeptic.
